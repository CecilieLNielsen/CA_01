        <h3>What we did together</h3>
        <p> We have helped each other out, when there have been problems and errors in code</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What Abed did</h3>
        <p>I have been working on assignment 4 (cars) both backend and frontend.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What Ali did</h3>
        <p>I have been working backend on assignment 1 (members) and associated tests. All tests in JokeFacadeTest and a single test (testGetAll) in JokeRessourceTest.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What Cecilie did</h3>
        <p>I have been working with frontend on the first three assignments (members, jokes and group contract). This includes working with the DOM and making fetch calls to the API.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What Rasmus did</h3>
        <p>I have done the joke backend from entitity to end points and the jokeDTO. So getAll, getJokeByid, getJokeByType and getRandom. 
            I also did the testGetRandom, testgetJokebyID, testGetByType and testGetByTypeError in JokeRessourceTest.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Our Group Contract</h3>
        <p>- We do our best and work whenever we can.</p>
        <p>- We will make daily updates online. </p>
        <p>- We are allowed to push to master as long as alle tests are green. </p>
        <p>- Codestandard are English.</p>
